    <div class="description">Programming, of course, involves the use of languages to boss around computers. Here are some of the ones I like to use.</div>
    <div id="java" class="description">
      <div id="langSub">Java</div>I have been programming in Java for 5 years now, starting my freshman year of high school. I have competition experience, attending HP CodeWars, as well as participating in Texas UIL competition. I have a working knowledge of various algorithm
      and data structure implementations in Java, as well as most of the standard libraries.</div>
    <div id="python" class="description">
      <div id="langSub">Python</div>One of my top favorite languages. My first exposure to this language came about 3 years ago, when I decided to write a small little program to help me with my physics homework. I have experience writing small web scrapers (to download
      images from websites), as well as math tools, CLI tools, natural language processing, and even a Raspberry Pi camera booth that plays Mad-Libs.</div>
    <div id="javascript" class="description">
      <div id="langSub">Javascript/Coffeescript</div>I'm currently a Javascript novice. I tend to use Coffeescript, as it leads to cleaner code, and the syntax reminds me of Python
      <3. My first foray into the depths of the language came this year at HackTX, a hackathon
        at UT Austin, where I made use of Socket.IO to write a hybrid mobile web-app that allowed people to draw on their televisions using DirecTV boxes.</div>
        <div id="cpp" class="description">
          <div id="langSub">C++</div>C++ is one of the languages that I hated from the beginning, but am quickly growing fond of. I first started using this language this year, as one of the introductory programming courses I was required to take. I am currently taking
          a Data Structures and Algorithms course where we are learning to love the language. Pointers and memory-management are starting to become some of my favorite concepts.</div>
